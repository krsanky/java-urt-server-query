This is code for querying the Urban Terror master server for the list of all
urban terror servers. (ip and port)
AND querying those servers for details like current players.

This is the JAVA repo.
There are SEPARATE repos:
https://github.com/krsanky/clj-urt-server-query
https://github.com/krsanky/go-urt-server-query
That implement similiar goals in Clojure and Go (golang).
Currently the Go one is the latest and greatest.
